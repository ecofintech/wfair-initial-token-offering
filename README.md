# Initial Token Offering (ITO)

#  WFair Custodian Fees Cooperative Incomes

Crowdfunding campaign for developing Wrapped Faircoin (WFAIR).
Wrapped Faircoin is an ERC20 smart contract backed by Faircoin asset for its use in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized applications (DAPPs).

Participants in the Initial Token Offering will receive Fair Token (FAIRT), redeemable at the end of the crowdsale by WFair Income Smart Contract (Lescovex ISC standar, contract name: Income Fair IFAIR).



## Participative Custodian Fees

The Custodian Nodes are the institution who holds the Faircoin assets and mint new WFAIR tokens for the merchants. In the case of WFAIR, this
will be played by the Local Nodes Federation of Ecofintech Coop. 
From the tokens minted, custodian fees will be charged for maintenance of the service. Fees will be charged in WFAIR tokens and exchanged to Ether for its distribution to Income Fair Smart Contract (IFAIR) holders.
