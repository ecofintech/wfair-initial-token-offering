# Initial Token Offering (ITO)





#  WFair Custodian Fees Open Cooperative Shares

Crowdfunding campaign for developing Wrapped Faircoin (WFAIR).
Wrapped Faircoin is an ERC20 token smart contract on Ethereum network backed by Faircoin asset for its use in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and decentralized applications (DAPPs).

Participants in the Initial Token Offering will receive Fair Token (FAIRT), redeemable at the end of the crowdsale by WFair Income Smart Contract (Lescovex ISC standar, contract name: Income Fair IFAIR).



## Cooperative Custodian Fees
